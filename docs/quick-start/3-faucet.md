## Our Faucet is Live


Users can claim Morph ETH & USDT to fund their initial activities.


### 3rd Party Ethereum Hoodi ETH Faucet

To use Morph's public testnet, obtain testnet ETH on Hoodi, then bridge it to the Morph testnet.

Here are a few Hoodi faucet apps:

Once you receive ETH on Hoodi, it should appear in your wallet on the Hoodi Network.

It may take a few seconds for the funds to show. You can check the status by searching your address on the [Hoodi Block Explorer](https://hoodi.etherscan.io).
