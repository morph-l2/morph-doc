Transaction fees on Morph work similarly to fees on Ethereum. However, Layer 2 introduces some unique aspects. Morph's optimistic zkEVM makes these differences easy to understand and even easier to handle. 

This page includes the formula for calculating the gas cost of transactions on Morph.
There are two kinds of costs for transactions on Morph: the L2 execution fee and the L1 data/security fee.


<!--

The transaction fees are collected into the `SequencerFeeVault` contract balance. This contract also tracks the amount we’ve historically withdrawn to L1 using `totalProcessed()(uint256)`.

The block producer receives no direct reward, and the `COINBASE` opcode returns the fee vault address.

## The L2 execution fee

Like Ethereum, transactions on Morph incur gas costs for computation and storage usage.

Every L2 transaction will pay some **execution** fee, equal to the amount of gas used multiplied by the gas price of the transaction.

The formula is straightforward:



<!--
We support [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) as a way to process L2 transaction fees.

In EIP-1559, the cost of a unit of gas is composed of two components:

- **Base fee**: This fee is the same for all transactions in a block. It varies between blocks based on the difference between the actual size of the blocks (which depends on the demand for block space) and the target block size. When the block uses more gas than the target block size，the base fee goes up to discourage demand. When the block uses less gas than the target block size，the base fee goes down to encourage demand.
- **Priority fee**: This fee is specified in the transaction itself and varies between transactions. Block proposers are expected to select the transactions that offer them the highest priority fees first.

There are some differences between Ethereum and Morph in this regard:

- ETH is not burned. Burning ETH on L2 would only lock it in the bridge forever.
- Some EIP 1559 parameters are different:

  | Parameter | Morph value | Ethereum value (for reference) |
  | - | -: | -: |
  | Block gas limit | 30,000,000 gas | 30,000,000 gas
  | Block gas target | 5,000,000 gas | 15,000,000 gas
  | EIP-1559 elasticity multiplier | 6 | 2
  | EIP-1559 denominator | 50 | 8
  | Maximum base fee increase (per block) | 10% | 12.5%
  | Maximum base fee decrease (per block) | 2% | 12.5%
  | Block time in seconds | 2 | 12


From an application development perspective, EIP-1559 introduces the following changes:

- The `BASEFEE` opcode is now supported. The `BASEFEE` opcodes return the base fee of the current block.
- The `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` and `eth_feeHistory` RPC methods are now supported. `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` returns a fee per gas that is an estimate of how much you can pay as a priority fee, or 'tip', to get a transaction included in the current block. `eth_feeHistory` returns a collection of historical gas information from which you can decide what to submit as your `maxFeePerGas` and/or `maxPriorityFeePerGas`.

-->



```
l2_execution_fee = l2_gas_price * l2_gas_used
```
<!--
transaction_gas_price = l2_base_fee + l2_priority_fee
-->

The amount of L2 gas used depends on the specific transaction. Due to EVM compatibility, gas usage on Morph is typically similar to Ethereum.


## The L1 data fee

Morph transactions are also published to Ethereum, crucial to Morph’s security as it ensures all data needed to verify Morph's state is always publicly available on Ethereum. 

Users must pay for the cost of submitting their transactions to Ethereum, known as the L1 data fee. This fee typically represents most of the total cost of a transaction on Morph.


This fee is based on four factors:

1. The current gas price on Ethereum - l1_base_fee
2. The gas cost to publish the transaction to Ethereum scales roughly with the size of the transaction (in bytes) - tx_data_gas
3. A fixed overhead cost denominated in gas. This is currently set to 2500.
4. A dynamic overhead cost which scales the L1 fee paid by a fixed number. This is currently set to 1.15.

Formula:

```
l1_data_fee = l1_base_fee * (tx_data_gas + fixed_overhead) * dynamic_overhead
```

Where `tx_data_gas` is:

```
tx_data_gas = count_zero_bytes(tx_data) * 4 + count_non_zero_bytes(tx_data) * 16
```


:::tip
You can read the parameter values from the GasPrice oracle contract. Morph has pre-deployed `GasPriceOracle`, accessible on Morph Holesky at [GasPriceOracle](https://explorer-holesky.morphl2.io/address/0x530000000000000000000000000000000000000F)

## Transaction fees' effect on software development

### Sending transactions

The process of sending a transaction on Morph is identical to sending a transaction on Ethereum.

When sending a transaction, you should provide a gas price that is greater than or equal to the current L2 gas price.

Like on Ethereum, you can query this gas price with the `eth_gasPrice` RPC method.

Similarly, you should set your transaction gas limit in the same way that you would set it on Ethereum (e.g. via `eth_estimateGas`).


### Displaying fees to users

Many Ethereum applications display estimated fees to users by multiplying the gas price by the gas limit.

However, as discussed earlier, users on Morph are charged both an L2 execution fee and an L1 data fee.

As a result, you should display the sum of both of these fees to give users the most accurate estimate of the total cost of a transaction.


#### Estimating the L2 execution fee

You can estimate the L2 execution fee by multiplying the gas price by the gas limit, just like on Ethereum.

#### [Estimating the L1 data fee](./understand-transaction-cost-on-morph#the-l1-data-fee)



#### Estimating the total fee

You can estimate the total fee by combining your estimates for the L2 execution fee and L1 data fee.

### Sending max ETH

Sending the maximum amount of ETH that a user has in their wallet is a relatively common use case.

When doing this, you will need to subtract the estimated L2 execution fee and the estimated L1 data fee from the amount of ETH you want the user to send.

Use the logic described above for estimating the total fee.

## Common RPC Errors

### Insufficient funds

- Error code: `-32000`
- Error message: `invalid transaction: insufficient funds for l1Fee + l2Fee + value`

You'll get this error when attempting to send a transaction and you don't have enough ETH to pay for the value of the transaction, the L2 execution fee, and the L1 data fee.
You might get this error when attempting to send max ETH if you aren't properly accounting for both the L2 execution fee and the L1 data fee.

### Gas price too low

- Error code: `-32000`
- Error message: `gas price too low: X wei, use at least tx.gasPrice = Y wei`

This is a custom RPC error that Morph returns when a transaction is rejected because the gas price is too low.
See the section on [Responding to gas price updates](#responding-to-gas-price-updates) for more information.

### Gas price too high
- Error code: `-32000`
- Error message: `gas price too high: X wei, use at most tx.gasPrice = Y wei`

This is a custom RPC error that Morph returns when a transaction is rejected because the gas price is too high.
We include this as a safety measure to prevent users from accidentally sending a transaction with an extremely high L2 gas price.
See the section on [Responding to gas price updates](#responding-to-gas-price-updates) for more information.
