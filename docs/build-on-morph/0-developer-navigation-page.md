If you’re ready to build applications on Morph, you're in the right place. 


For those who are regular users or visiting for the first time, we recommend starting with our [For Users section](../about-morph/0-user-navigation-page.md) to explore introductory content such as definitions, our vision, key concepts, and more.

### What is Morph?

Morph is the first optimistic zkEVM Ethereum Layer 2 solution that is 100% EVM compatible. Building on Morph is just like building on Ethereum. If you’re experienced in Ethereum development, you'll find your existing code, tooling, and dependencies are fully compatible with Morph.
### Getting Started

To help you get started, here’s a recommended navigation through our documentation:

**Fundamental Concepts**: Start here to learn the core components of Morph, including Morph’s Modular Design, the Decentralized Sequencer Network, and the Responsive Validity Proof system.
