### What is Morph?

Morph is the first optimistic zkEVM Ethereum Layer 2 solution that is 100% EVM compatible. Building on Morph is just like building on Ethereum. If you’re experienced in Ethereum development, you'll find your existing code, tooling, and dependencies are fully compatible with Morph.
### Getting Started

**Fundamental Concepts**: Start here to learn the core components of Morph, including Morph’s Modular Design, the Decentralized Sequencer Network, and the Responsive Validity Proof system.

**Advanced Concepts**: Dive deeper into topics such as understanding transaction costs on Morph and differences between Morph and Ethereum.

**Developer Guides**: Access comprehensive guides on verifying smart contracts, running a Morph node, deploying contracts, and more.

**Developer Resources**: Find detailed API methods, contract addresses and other useful developer resources.
