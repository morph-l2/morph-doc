Envio is a modern, multi-chain EVM blockchain indexing framework speed-optimized for querying real-time and historical data on Morph Holesky and Morph Mainnet. 

Designed with a core focus on delivering superior performance and seamless developer experience, Envio empowers the next generation of consumer apps. 

The [Quickstart](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/contract-import) allows you to instantly autogenerate a basic indexer and query your smart contract data on Morph. This is the quickest way to get going and likely the starting point for most developers.
