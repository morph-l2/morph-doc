### LayerZero

LayerZero is a messaging protocol, not a blockchain. Using smart contracts deployed on each chain, in combination with Decentralized Verifier Networks (DVNs) and Executors, LayerZero enables different blockchains to seamlessly interact with one another.

### CCIP (Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol)

CCIP is a cross-chain communication and value transfer protocol, not a blockchain.
By leveraging smart contracts deployed across supported blockchains, together with Chainlink Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs) and a standardized messaging layer, CCIP enables secure and reliable communication and token transfers between different blockchains.

CCIP is designed with a strong emphasis on security, reliability, and institutional-grade risk management, offering features such as configurable rate limits, transaction monitoring, and multiple layers of verification. Through Chainlink’s oracle infrastructure, CCIP provides a unified interface for developers to build cross-chain applications without relying on custom bridges or fragmented messaging systems.

CCIP is maintained and secured by Chainlink, and is intended to serve as a foundational interoperability layer for cross-chain DeFi, tokenized assets, and enterprise-grade blockchain applications.
