# Monitoring

## Tenderly

Tenderly provides comprehensive monitoring and security solutions for Morph, allowing you to stay in loop with smart contract interactions and respond proactively to potential issues. 

- Configure [Alerts](https://docs.tenderly.co/alerts/intro-to-alerts?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=morph) for notifications on transactions and contract events to enable awareness of critical issues or signal problems to external webhooks. 
- Use [Alerts API](https://docs.tenderly.co/reference/api#/operations/createAlert?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=morph) to set up custom alerts with more granular triggering criteria.
- Use [Web3 Actions](https://docs.tenderly.co/web3-actions/intro-to-web3-actions?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=morph) to automate predefined responses, improving security and user experience. 
- Leverage [Simulation RPC](https://docs.tenderly.co/simulations/single-simulations#simulate-via-rpc?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=morph) to assess transaction impacts beforehand. Take timely action to safeguard the network and maintain a smooth operational workflow.
