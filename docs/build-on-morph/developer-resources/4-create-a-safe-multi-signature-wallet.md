## What is Morph Safe?

![safemultisig](../../../assets/docs/dev/safemultisig.png)

Morph Safe is a fork managed by the Morph team in collaboration with [Protofire](https://www.protofire.io/), an official partner of the Safe team. It is a multi-signature smart contract wallet, which means it requires a minimum number of signatures to approve a transaction before it can occur.

For example, if your business has three main stakeholders, you can configure the wallet to require approval from either two out of three or all three individuals before a transaction can proceed. This security measure ensures that no single person can compromise the funds.

In addition to robust security, Morph Safe offers complete self-custody over funds. The smart contract deployed for the wallet has full control over the wallet's contents and does not rely on any trusted external party for execution.
