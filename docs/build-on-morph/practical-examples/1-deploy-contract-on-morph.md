The Morph Sepolia Testnet allows anyone to deploy a smart contract on Morph. In this tutorial, you will learn how to deploy a contract on Morph Sepolia using common tools for developing on Ethereum. 

This [demo repo](https://github.com/morph-l2/morph-examples/tree/main/contract-deploy-demo) illustrates contract deployment with [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry).

:::tip
  Before you start deploying the contract, you need to request test tokens from a Sepolia faucet and use the
  [bridge](https://bridge-testnet.morphl2.io) to transfer some test ETH from _Sepolia_ to _Morph Sepolia_. 

  Or you can direct obatin Morph sepolia ETH for testing.
  
  See our [Faucet](../../quick-start/3-faucet.md) for details.

## Deploy contracts with Remix

## Hardhat Contract Deployment Examples

### Install Dependencies

If you haven't already, install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install).

```bash
cd contract-deployment-demos/hardhat-demo
yarn install
```
This will install everything you need include hardhat for you.


### Compile

Compile your contract

```bash
yarn compile
```

### Test

This will run the test script in test/Lock.ts

```bash
yarn test
```

### Deploy

 Create a `.env` file following the example `.env.example` in the root directory. Change `PRIVATE_KEY` to your own account private key in the `.env`.

 And Change the network settings in the hardhat.config.ts file with the following information:

   ```javascript
    morphTestnet: {
      url: process.env.MORPH_TESTNET_URL || "",
      accounts:
        process.env.PRIVATE_KEY !== undefined ? [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY] : [],
      gasPrice: 2000000000
    }
   ```
Then run the following command to deploy the contract on the Morph Sepolia Testnet. This will run the deployment script that set the initialing parameters, you can edit the script in scripts/deploy.ts

```bash
yarn deploy:morphTestnet
```

### Verify your contracts on Morph Explorer

To verify your contract through hardhat, you need to add the following Etherscan and Sourcify configs to your hardhat.config.js file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    morphSepolia: { ... }
  },
  etherscan: {
    apiKey: {
      morphTestnet: 'anything',
    },
    customChains: [
      {
        network: 'morphTestnet',
        chainId: 2710,
        urls: {
          apiURL: 'https://explorer-api-testnet.morphl2.io/api ',
          browserURL: 'https://explorer-testnet.morphl2.io/',
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```
Then run the hardhat verfiy command to finish the verification

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network morphTestnet DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS <ConstructorParameter>
```

For example

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network morphTestnet 0x8025985e35f1bAFfd661717f66fC5a434417448E '0.00001'
```


Once succeed, you can check your contract and the deployment transaction on [Morph Sepolia Explorer](https://explorer-testnet.morphl2.io)


## Foundry Contract Deployment Examples

### Install Foundry
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

Then go the right folder of our example:

```bash
cd contract-deployment-demos/foundry-demo
```

### Compile

```bash
forge build
```
### Deploy

A Deployment script and use of environment variables has already been set up for you. You can view the script at script/Counter.s.sol

Rename your .env.example file to .env and fill in your private key. The RPC URL has already been filled in along with the verifier URL. 

To use the variables in your .env file run the following command: 

```shell
source .env
```

You can now deploay to Morph with the following command: 

```shell
forge script script/Counter.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --broadcast --private-key $DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY --legacy
```

Adjust as needed for your own script names. 

### Verify 

Verification requires some flags passed to the normal verification script. You can verify using the command below:

```bash
 forge verify-contract <YourConrtactAddress Counter\
  --chain 2710 \
  --verifier-url $VERIFIER_URL \
  --verifier blockscout --watch
```

Once succeed, you can check your contract and the deployment transaction on [Morph Sepolia Explorer](https://explorer-testnet.morphl2.io)
